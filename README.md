# Face Recognition Webcam Project

This project is a program that uses a webcam to detect faces in real-time. It utilizes the Dlib library for face detection and extracts features from recognized faces.

## Features

- Real-time face detection
- Multiple face recognition
- Landmark extraction from faces

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dlib
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Improvements
  # Resolution Adjustment
  Lowering the webcam resolution can reduce the number of pixels to process, thus improving speed. For example, set it to 640x480 resolution.

  # Frame Rate Adjustment
  Instead of processing every frame, you can skip frames at regular intervals. For example, perform face recognition every 2-3 frames.

  # Algorithm Optimization
  You can use faster face detection and recognition algorithms. For instance, you might use OpenCV's Haar Cascade instead of Dlib.

  # Multithreading
  Run frame capture and face recognition in separate threads to perform both tasks in parallel. You can utilize Python's threading or multiprocessing modules.

  # GPU Usage
  If possible, leverage the GPU to enhance computation speed. Libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch support GPU acceleration.

  # Caching and Memoization
  Store results for already recognized faces, and skip the recognition process when the same face appears again.

  # Code Optimization
  Improve performance by reducing unnecessary computations or optimizing frequently called functions. For example, change the code so that transformed images are only computed when needed, rather than every time.
